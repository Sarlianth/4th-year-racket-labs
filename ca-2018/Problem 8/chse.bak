;Write a function chse in Racket that takes three lists x, y and z of equal length and
;containing only 0’s and 1’s. It should return a list containing the elements of y in
;the positions where x is 1 and the elements of z otherwise.

(define (chse x y z)
    ; if list x is null just do nothing, return empty list
    (if (null? x)
        '()
        ; check if car of lists x and y are the same
        (cond((= (car x) 1)
             ; add y into the result list and call chse again with the cdr of the three lists
             (cons (car y) (chse (cdr x) (cdr y) (cdr z))))
             ; or if the values of x and y are not the same
             ; add y into the new list and call chse again with the cdr of the three lists
             (else (cons (car z) (chse (cdr x) (cdr y) (cdr z)))))))

; test the chse function
(chse (list 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1) (list 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1) (list 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1))
