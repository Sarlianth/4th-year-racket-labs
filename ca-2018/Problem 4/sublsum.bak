;Write a function sublsum in Racket that takes a list (of integers) as input and returns
;a list of sublists of it that sum to zero. For this problem, you can use the
;combinations built-in function. Note the order of the sublists and their elements
;doesnâ€™t matter

;Function that sums all elements of the list
;I will use it in combination with another function to return sublists of lists that sum to zero
(define (sum_list l)
  (if (null? l) 0
      (+ (car l) (sum_list (cdr l)))))

(sum_list (list -5 3 2 1))
